## Abstract
We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with environmental constraints such as corridors and furniture. 
Previous methods fail to consider all types of interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. 
In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. 
We first split the representations of different components in the environment and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal (st) graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. 
Based on the heterogeneous st-graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions among entities through space and time. 
HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. 
Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success and efficiency in challenging navigation scenarios. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our pipeline achieves better zero-shot generalization capability than previous works when the densities of humans and obstacles change.

## Overview
This repository is organized in five parts: 
- `crowd_nav/` folder contains configurations and policies used in the simulator.
- `crowd_sim/` folder contains the simulation environment.
- `training/` contains the code for the RL policy networks and ppo algorithm. 
- `trained_models/` contains some pretrained models provided by us.

## Setup
1. In a conda environment or virtual environment with Python 3.x, install the required python package
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install Pytorch 1.12.1 and torchvision following the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v1121)

3. Install [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines#installation) 
```
git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines.git
cd baselines
pip install -e .
```

4. Install [Python-RVO2](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/Python-RVO2) library



## Run the code
### Training
- Modify the configurations in `crowd_nav/configs/config.py`. Especially,
  - Gym environment: 
    - Set `env.env_name = 'CrowdSim3DTbObsHie-v0'` for A*+CNN baseline. Set `env.env_name = 'CrowdSim3DTbObs-v0'` for all other methods.
    - Different environment layouts:
      - For random environment in pure simulation, 
        - Set `env.scenario = 'circle_crossing'`
        - Set `env.mode = 'sim'`
      - For sim2real environments (Hallway, Lounge),
        - Set `env.scenario = 'csl_workspace'`
        - Set `env.csl_workspace_type = 'lounge'` or `'hallway'`
        - Set `env.mode = 'sim2real'`
    - Number of humans: 
      - Dynamic humans: change `sim.human_num` and `sim.human_num_range`
      - Static humans: change `sim.static_human_num`, `sim.static_human_range`
    - Number of obstacles:
      - Set `sim.static_obs = True`
      - Change `sim.static_obs_num` and `sim.static_obs_num_range`
  - Robot policy: set `robot.policy` to
    - `selfAttn_merge_srnn_lidar` for HEIGHT (ours) and its ablations
      - No attn: `SRNN.use_hr_attn = False`, `SRNN.use_self_attn = False`
      - RH: `SRNN.use_hr_attn = True`, `SRNN.use_self_attn = False`
      - HH: `SRNN.use_hr_attn = False`, `SRNN.use_self_attn = True`
      - RH + HH (ours): `SRNN.use_hr_attn = True`, `SRNN.use_self_attn = True`
    - `lidar_gru` for A*+CNN
    - `dsrnn_obs_vertex` for DS-RNN
    - `homo_transformer_obs` for HomoGAT
  - Logging and saving:
    - All logs and checkpoints will be saved in `training.output_dir`
    - To resume training from a previous checkpoint,
      - Set `training.resume = 'rl'`
      - Set `training.load_path` to the path of the previous checkpoint

- After you change the configurations, run
  ```
  python train.py 
  ```

### Testing 
#### In simulation:
- Please modify the test arguments in line 20-33 of `test.py` (**Don't set the argument values in terminal!**)
  - Set `--model_dir` to the path of the saved folder from training
  - Robot policy:
    - To test RL-based methods (all methods in the paper except DWA),
      - Set `--dwa` to False, `--cpu` to False, `--test_model` to the name of the checkpoint to be tested
    - To test DWA,
      - Set `--dwa` to True, `--cpu` to True (DWA also needs a dummy `--model_dir`! The directory can be anything with a `configs/` folder.)
  - To save the gif and pictures of each episode, set `--save_slides` to True (Note: Saving the visuals will significantly slow down testing)
- Run   
  ```
  python test.py 
  ```
- To test policies in OOD environments, run `test_less_human.py`/`test_less_obs.py`/`test_more_human.py`/`test_more_obs.py`  
Note that the `config.py` in the `--model_dir` folder will be loaded, instead of those in the root directory.  
The testing results are logged in `trained_models/your_output_dir/test/` folder, and are also printed on terminal.  
If you set `--save_slides` to True in `test.py`, you will be able to see visualizations like this:  
<img src="/figures/sim.gif" height="420" />

#### In real-world:
- In the folder of a trained checkpoint, in `config.py`,
  - Set `env.env_name = 'rosTurtlebot2iEnv-v0'` 
  - Change `sim2real` configurations if needed
- Set up the sensors, perception modules, and the robot following our sim2real tutorial [here](https://github.com/Shuijing725/CrowdNav_Sim2Real_Turtlebot)
  - **Note:** The above repo only serves as a reference point for the sim2real transfer. Since there are lots of uncertainties in real-world experiments that may affect performance, we cannot guarantee that it is reproducible on all cases. 
- Run   
  ```
  python test.py 
  ```
- From terminal, input the robot goal position and press enter, the robot will move if everything is up and running

## Disclaimer
1. We only tested our code in Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8. The code may work on other OS or other versions of Python, but we do not have any guarantee.  

2. The performance of our code can vary depending on the choice of hyperparameters and random seeds (see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/rkewa3/d_what_are_your_machine_learning_superstitions/)). 
Unfortunately, we do not have time or resources for a thorough hyperparameter search. Thus, if your results are slightly worse than what is claimed in the paper, it is normal. 
To achieve the best performance, we recommend some manual hyperparameter tuning.
